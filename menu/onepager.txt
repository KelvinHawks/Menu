Delicacy Restaurant.

This is a website where a restaurant is able to indicate what it offers through technology.
This eliminates paper work and it is easy to use.
I decided to come up with this project because most people nowadays own a smartphone and they are intellectual compared to sometimes back.
The world is transitioning to technology and everything will be done through technology.
It will be beneficial if it is adopted by many restaurants since the customers will have an easy time ordering their preferred meal.
I used JavaScript for UI interface and php for a server side.
